## 🆕 🔥 [SMLFDL](applications/SMLFDL.py)  - 📄[article][SMLFDL_article]
<sub><b>SVMs multi-class loss feedback based discriminative dictionary learning for image classification</b></sub>  

> SMLFDL integrates dictionary learning and support vector machines training into a unified learning
framework by looping the designed multi-class loss term, which
is inspired by the feedback mechanism in cybernetics.

analysis has been done on scene-15 dataset.   
Feature vectors has been prepared by four-level `spatial pyramid`, dense `DAISY` feature description followed by PCA.  
As article proposed SMLFDL are faster in predictions and converge in lower epochs.  
<sub>code for features will be added soon.</sub>
